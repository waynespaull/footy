# Odd Ball

The idea: Create a model to predict the outcome of football matches with greater accuracy than the bookmakers.

## Introduction

Using two simple datasets I created a few features that performed well enough across a variety of models to make me believe that it is possible to create a model that could outperform the bookmakers. A third dataset was used to compare my results to those of the bookmakers.
