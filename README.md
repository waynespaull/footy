# Odd Ball

The idea: Create a model to predict the outcome of football matches with greater accuracy than the bookmakers.

## Introduction

Using two simple datasets I created a few features that performed adequately enough to make me think that it is possible to create a model that could outperform the bookmakers. A third dataset was used to compare my results to those of the bookmakers.

Below you'll find a data dictionary outlining the features I created as well as the datasets used. Also, a link to my conclusions and thoughts about how I'd take this project forward.
